                As a professional with a diverse background spanning over a decade, I bring a unique blend of skills and experiences to the world of software development. With a strong foundation in restaurant management, where I honed my leadership, team-building, and customer service skills for seven years, followed by three years managing an e-commerce business where I developed a keen eye for data analysis and online customer engagement, I've successfully transitioned into the exciting world of full-stack coding.

                My journey into coding was fueled by a relentless curiosity and a desire to create innovative solutions. Having completed a rigorous full-stack coding boot camp, I've gained proficiency in modern programming languages, web development, and problem-solving. I'm passionate about crafting elegant and efficient code to solve real-world challenges and thrive in dynamic, collaborative environments.

                What sets me apart is my ability to approach coding projects with a fresh perspective, drawing upon my experiences in management and e-commerce to think critically and deliver results. I'm excited to leverage my diverse background to bring a unique perspective to coding projects and contribute to the success of your team.

                In addition to my technical skills, I'm a dedicated learner who thrives on challenges and is committed to staying at the forefront of technology trends. I'm eager to apply my problem-solving abilities, adaptability, and strong work ethic to make meaningful contributions to your organization as a passionate coder.
